## Developing

This section should get you running with **Amplify Codegen**. You will need the latest version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system and developing locally also requires `yarn` workspaces. You can install it [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable).

Start by, [Forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the main branch of [amplify-codegen](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-codegen).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[username]/amplify-codegen.git
$ cd amplify-codegen

$ yarn setup-dev
```
Before pushing code or sending a pull request, do the following:

- At the command line, run `npm run lint` at the top-level directory. This invokes lerna to check for lint errors in all of our packages.
- You can use `eslint` to fix some of the lint errors. To use it, go to the package that has errors and run `lint-fix`
- If there are any remaining lint errors, resolve them manually. Linting your code is a best practice that ensures good code quality so it's important that you don't skip this step.
